Hypocrisy 101

"How soon can you join? We need somebody who can join within a week."

"You'll need to serve 3 months of notice period, we can't do anything about it."

If the employee is so important to you that you need 3 months to replace them, you should've treated them well in the first place - and they probably wouldn't have left.

A smooth exit process is underrated.

Do it well, and the employee might consider returning in the future.

Make it complicated, and the employee will ensure that none of their friends/acquaintances ends up joining your company ever again. üôÉ

Curious, how was your exit process in your previous org?

 What Causes Breakdowns in Traffic Flow?

The layman's definition of congestion is "too many cars trying to use a highway at the same time". Transportation engineers formalize this idea as capacity‚Äîthe ability to move vehicles past a point over a given span of time. When the capacity of a highway section is exceeded, traffic flow breaks down, speeds drop, and vehicles crowd together. These actions cause traffic to back up behind the disruption.

Basically, there are three types of traffic flow behavior that will cause traffic flow to break down:

1- "Bunching" of vehicles as a result of reduced speed.
2- Intended Interruption to Traffic Flow.
3- Vehicle Merging Maneuvers. 

With all this information, I believe this dog got the concept and found the solution better than me as a Highway engineer ;)
